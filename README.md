# Kali-Clean
kali i3 desktop setup.

## Installation

```
./install.sh
```

After the script is done reboot and select i3 on the login screen. Then open a terminal (`ctrl+return`) run `lxappearance`and select ark-dark theme and change the icons to whatever you like (I used papyrus).

## Note
all shortcuts are in .config
